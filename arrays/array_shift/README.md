# Shift Array
## Challenge

Write a function called insertShiftArray which takes in an array and the value to be added. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return an array with the new value added at the middle index.

[2,4,6,8], 5	     -> [2,4,5,6,8]
[4,8,15,23,42], 16	 -> [4,8,15,16,23,42]
