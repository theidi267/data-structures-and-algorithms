# Array Binary Search
## Challenge

Write a function called BinarySearch which takes in 2 parameters: a sorted array and the search key. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return the index of the arrayâ€™s element that is equal to the search key, or -1 if the element does not exist.

[4,8,15,16,23,42], 15	       ->  2
[11,22,33,44,55,66,77], 90   ->	-1
