# Reverse Array
## Challenge

  Write a function called reverseArray which takes an array as an argument. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return the provided array argument with elements in reversed order.

  Examples:

  [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] -->	[6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
  [89, 2354, 3546, 23, 10, -923, 823, -12] --> [-12, 823, -923, 10, 23, 3546, 2354, 89]
