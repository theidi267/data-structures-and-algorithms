[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/theidi267/data-structures-and-algorithms.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/theidi267/data-structures-and-algorithms)

## Challenge

Write a function called tree_intersection that takes two binary tree parameters.
Without utilizing any of the built-in library methods available to your language, return a set of values found in both trees.

Examples:

* Input:

![binary_tree_1](assets/BT1.png) ![binary_tree_2](assets/BT2.png)

* Output: [100,160,125,175,200,350,500]
